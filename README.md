# Pneumonia-Detection-through-X-ray-reports
This project utilizes X-ray images of a person's lungs to accurately predict their health status, specifically detecting whether the 
the patient is normal or affected by pneumonia.
By employing advanced image recognition techniques and leveraging extensive training on a vast array of X-ray reports, the system 
maintains a high level of accuracy in generating results.
This groundbreaking project holds immense importance in the field of healthcare as it aims to predict the status of a person's lungs 
by analyzing X-ray images. By employing image recognition techniques and leveraging a vast training dataset of X-ray reports, the system 
accurately determines whether the patient is normal or affected by pneumonia. The application of this technology has far-reaching 
implications, enabling faster and more efficient diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained areas. Additionally, this project 
utilizes Teachable Machine, a powerful tool that facilitates the training of machine learning models without requiring extensive 
coding knowledge.
By integrating Teachable Machine, the project ensures that accuracy and reliability are maintained, making it a valuable asset in 
the realm of medical diagnostics.
